The aim of this project is to control the traffic by analysing the density of vehicles in each lane. Ultrasonic sensors are used to determine the density and Arduino mega is used as the central processing unit. Sound sensors are also installed on each lane in order to detect any emergency vehicle.

Tools used: Arduino IDE, C programming
Components: Ultrasonic sensors, sound sensors, Arduino Mega, Wires
